<h1>University</h1>
Since October 2019 I'm studying applied computer science at <a href="https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/de" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit">Ruhr-University Bochum</a>.<br>
Since then I've learned C/C++, PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and Python. Before I've only known Java and C#.
