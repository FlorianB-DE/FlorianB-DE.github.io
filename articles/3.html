<b>Homeland Shelter</b> is a Dungeon RPG where you have to collect and equip armor, weapons, etc... to survive. Every Dungeon is unique in the way it is generated.<br>
It's been programmed entirely from scratch in Java without any frameworks or libraries  except the standard Java library.

<h3>Java Game-library</h3>
(<a href="https://git.noc.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/beckefp6/oom_project" target="_blank">git</a>)<br><br>
An open source game library which was originally created for a Homework at university. For now it only works in 2D but I'll work on 3D support asap. <br>
It was also made from scratch in Java and currently comes with my homework integrated. This is what the engine is currently able to produce with minimal effort:

The world is divided in chunks of 16 by 16 blocks which are procedurally generated and therefore infinite.
The engine is capable of processing thousands of blocks with their corresponding colliders and detect their collisions without considerable performance issues.<br>
The current look on this engine is done for testing purposes only! Therefor it reuses Sprites already used in e.g.: Homeland Shelter
